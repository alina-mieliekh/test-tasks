Some teams are containing "_deleted" suffix,
its because they are marked as deleted.

Please, write a function, that takes teams list,
removes "_deleted" suffix, if its present,
and prints comma separated teams list into
tag with "dynamic-teamlist" id.

Ideally, text in "plain-teamlist" and "dynamic-teamlist" should be the same.
